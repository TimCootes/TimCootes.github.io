<h2>Acknowlegements</h2>
MonOTom Publishing would like to thank Mr Paul of Chisbury for his inspired efforts to bring tales from the world of Wynderland to the attention of peoples across the many planes of existence.  This collection would not have appeared without his work.<br>
We would also like to thank Bag, John, Mike, David, Tom and Jules for their creativity and interpretation of the characters so wilfully misrepresented in these pages.<br>
And, of course, to the forebearance and support of partners and family.<br>
