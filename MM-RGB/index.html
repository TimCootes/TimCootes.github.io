<h2>Preface to the Digitally Re-mastered Multi-colour Edition (2020)</h2>
The original Meringue Man cartoons were drawn between 1985 and 1990.  They were distributed by means of photocopying and the Royal Mail to a small group of interested connoisseurs.<br>
Soon after learning how to write web-pages in trusty html, the author scanned the first 13 episodes and put them up on the world wide web, where they soon gained an international following. Or at least, someone from Denmark quite liked them, which is good enough for me.<br>
However, back in the early 90's most home computers were connected to the internet with dial up modems, which meant we cared about every kilobyte of file size.  Thus the digital scans were low resolution and heavily compressed, introducing artifacts into the images.<br>
The author got distracted by other things and never got around to uploading issues 14 and 15, presented here for the first time to a global audience.<br>
Recently the author's interest in drawing re-awakened, and the possibilities of animation became more apparent.<br>
The author rediscovered the original artwork for MM, including previously unseen full colour versions.  These have now been lovingly scanned, and are presented here along with newly created animations of some of your favourite characters.<br>
Enjoy.<br>
